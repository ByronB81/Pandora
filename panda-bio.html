    <p>My humble beginnings are unknown to even I but my earliest memories are of riding home with my new owner. He and I got a long together really well, we like eating a lot of the same things actually. As I grew from a pup I learned to be fast and agile, beagles are traditionally used to hunt rabbit so foot speed is important, and of course staying in shape. Over the years we moved from the beaches of San Diego to the smoky streets of Los Angeles and now I live in the fresh air of Portland.</p>
    <p>I am especially good at sniffing new things, alerting my owner to new people at the door, and sleeping. Sleeping is REALLY my specialty, I work hard to have this level of skill and I hope to inspire a whole new generation of sleepers. Dream on my brethren!</p>
